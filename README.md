# Frame Status

Statuses for Frames on Figma.

Based on Status by Bram Schulting, see it on [GitHub](https://github.com/bramschulting/status-for-figma).

## Tips
- You can select multiple frames at once. Each frame will get its own status badge.
- Use the keyboard shortcut to quickly set a status: hit `cmd /` in Mac and `ctrl /` on Windows, type a Status (e.g. “Done”) and hit return.
